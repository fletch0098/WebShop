# WebShop
WebShop for Sana Commerce

## Overview
This is my demo webshop for viewing a creating a simple product entity. There are 2 strage options, the session, or a SQL database. I have all the basics here, but due to time constrainsts for this demo I have not implemented everything.

Here is a list of enhancements I would do with more time:

1. Create layouts for header and footer to reuse code.
2. Create a proper client side validation system.
3. Friendlier urls.
4. Better UI.
